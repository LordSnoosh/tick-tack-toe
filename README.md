WELCOME TO TIC-TACK-TOE! This is a simplified version of the classic game. we will render a game board, display a starting message, and the logic will flow to complete a game for either player or a tie.

handelMove - renders the game board until there is a winning combo in the player's array, adjusting the turn of the player.
getWinner - uses the itteration through all possible winning combos(winningComb) until the array matches any of the combos.
render - simply renders the game board to a new state dependant on what box was just taken in the current turn.
initialize - when there is no declared winner the current state of the board is updated.
